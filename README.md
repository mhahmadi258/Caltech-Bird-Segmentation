# Caltech-Bird-Segmentation

In this project, I tried to implement Unet and D-linknet, which are two famous architectures for segmentation tasks. I implemented these two architectures and trained them on Caltech Bird 2010 dataset.

Note that Binary Cross Entropy(BCE) is an inappropriate loss function for this task. I used this loss function because it is simple and easy to use and the goal of this project was the implementation of the architecture.
